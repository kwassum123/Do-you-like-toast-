<h1>
Why History is Important
</h1>
<p>
  Who cares about history, right? How could anything that happened in the past possibly have any effect on what's going on in the world?
These are questions that drive absoultly wild. History is essential for being able to understand why things are the way they are or why 
they were the way they were. Many people have been cheated out of the beauty of the study of history by boring rote assignments in high 
school that were nothing more than memorization; there's so much more that I'd love to share.
